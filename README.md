# VoxMod

VoxMod is an online, browser-based tool to help trans* and non-binary people to develop, train and monitor their voice.

This project was started at [Trans*Code 2016](http://trans.tech/).

See the [Mockup Demo](https://transcodevoicetraining.github.io/VoxMod/welcome.html) and [Introductory Documentation](https://transcodevoicetraining.github.io/VoxMod/).

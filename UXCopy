Welcome to VoxMod!

Modding your voice is rarely easy. But your voyage can take you to strange and wonderful places. VoxMod is here to help you on your way.

VoxMod was produced with trans and non-binary people in mind, to help you achieve the voice you want.
Because the way voices sound varies so much, by accent, by country etc, our options focus on what you want to change and how you want to change it.
You should be able to sound the way you want to sound, not the way that anyone else thinks you should sound.

VoxMod isn't designed for speech impediments like stammering or stutters yet. Here are some apps that might be more useful.

SWIPE RIGHT TO GET STARTED

//Goals

Get started by having a think about what you want to change. Tap one, and you'll be taken to the Galaxy you want to take.
You can switch Galaxies at any time.

Raising pitch []

Lowering pitch []

Regulating your volume []

Your Confidence []

[I don’t know?] 

It’s perfectly ok not to know straight away - let’s try and refine why you want to change your voice.

Do you want your voice to sound higher [] or lower? []

Do you want to speak louder? []

Do you want to speak more butch [] or more femme? []

Are you worried about being able to maintain the voice you want in different situations, like on the phone? []

Do you wany your voice to sound more [] or less monotone []

//Pitch Route
Welcome to the Pitch Galaxy. Here we're going to focus on how high or low your voice sounds. If you want to read more about pitch you can find more information at the What is Pitch planet.
Otherwise select the Pitch Baseline planet to get started.

//Pitch goals

Lets start by setting your current baseline. Have a go at reading the text, without forcing your voice to do anything. Keep going for thirty seconds.

>>Stars are formed over billions of years, by small pieces of matter slowly drifting towards each other under the force of their gravity. Gradually, the dust becomes rocks, and the pieces of rock smash together with greater force.

Wonderful! Thanks for that. Your voice has an average pitch of {averagePitch} Hz. Also, your average volume is {averageVolume} and your rate of speaking is {wpm} words per minute.  So it makes sense to start with a goal of {averageHz + 60}.
You can focus on volume and words per minute in other galaxies. But let's just focus on pitch for now. 

Have a go at trying to speak louder. Read the text out loud and try and keep the bar as close to your target meter as possible. Please don’t strain your voice!

>>As the force increases, the energy produced starts to get incredibly hot and the rock starts to burn. Soon, atoms are being bashed together with such energy that they fuse, releasing even more energy and lighting up space.

(if met target)
Wow! Fantastic effort - you've met your target of {userTarget} Hz for 30 seconds! 
(if not met target)
So close! Excellent attempt though, and you're making fantastic progress, don't stop now :)

//What is Pitch
This planet is a chance for you to get a deeper understanding of what pitch is and how you can modify it. 
Important Note: This app is a resource, not a definitive advice service. We're in the process of trying to get some more clinical advice on how to improve our resource.

What is Pitch?
Pitch is technically defined as the quality of a sound governed by the rate of vibrations producing it; the degree of highness or lowness of a tone.
To most of us, that doesn't really mean a lot. A better way of putting it might be how high or low the tone of your voice is. That tone is measured in Hertz(Hz), which is a measure of frequency - how many waves in a second. 
If you think of your voice as a sound wave, with peaks and troughs, a higher voice will have more peaks and troughs, whereas a lower voice will have less. 

What causes pitch to change in human voice boxes? 
Human voices are produced by a combination of air from the lungs, your tongue and teeth, and your voicebox. 

You can write anything you'd like to remember about pitch below, and it will be added to your journal. 

//Volume goals

Lets start by setting your current baseline. Have a go at reading the text, without forcing your voice to do anything. Keep going for thirty seconds.

>>I deserve to feel comfortable with my voice, and feeling confident deserves daily practice. I will take time for myself to explore the sound of my voice in a comfortable place. I'll reward myself when I make progress, but also I'll remember not to be worried if I don't make progress as quickly as I hope.

Brilliant! Thanks for that. So it makes sense to start with a goal of {averageDb + 30}.

Have a go at trying to speak louder. Read the text out loud and try and keep the bar as close to your target meter as possible. Please don’t strain your voice!

>>Most of the time the changes to our voice take place over a long period of time. We therefore don't always notice it happening. Make sure you keep a recording of your voice, but keep an eye on the progress graphs as well. You might be surprised with what you find! The important thing is to try and do a little each day.

//Outcomes

(if met target)
Wow! Fantastic effort - you've met your target of {userTarget} decibels for 30 seconds! 
(if not met target)
So close! Excellent attempt though, and you're making fantastic progress, don't stop now :)

//Post Practice
Remember to keep practicing as regularly as possible; you'll start to see the results over time.

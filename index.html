<p>Modding your voice is rarely easy. But your voyage can take you to strange and wonderful places. VoxMod is here to help you on your way.</p>
<p>VoxMod was produced with trans and non-binary people in mind. Because the way voices sound varies so much, by accent, by country etc, our options focus on what you want to change and how you want to change it. You should be able to sound the way you want to sound, not the way that anyone else thinks you should sound. </p>
<p>Get started by having a think about what you want to change. Check any you think apply, and those routes will open up in your galaxy. </p>
